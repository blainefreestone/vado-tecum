# Dominus Linguae
Dominus Linguae is a personal Latin tutor using the power of LLMs.

The idea behind this project is the need for students of Latin to read and write a huge amount of Latin to improve their abilites. A tutor that can provide the student reading material, thought provoking questions about it, and analyze and improve the response would be extremely beneficial for student learning Latin. 

Fiam dominus linguae Latinae!
